      <p>This is the app that I worked on during the <a href = "https://healthhack.uchealth.edu/#/home"> UC Health Hack 2018</a>.  It was designed mainly to locate the optimal location for getting a flu shot based on price, perks, and distance from you. We also wanted to digitize medical proof of getting flu shots by having a camera function to save the record to your phone or to a cloud service like Amazon Web Services.  It is still open for further development, so if you are interested in sponsoring it or fleshing it out further, please <a href = "../../contact">contact</a> me.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I developed the basic concept of this app, as well as basic proof of concept work with my roomate <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/atatyazdi/">Ata</a> and three other students.  Unfortunately, we weren't quite able to get a technical demo with all of our planned features in place during the hackathon (turns out learning Swift in 24 hours is hard), but we did develop a clear idea of what we wanted the app to do and how to do it.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am working on finishing the writeup describing the app and its features, and will have it available here for download once it's complete.</p>
